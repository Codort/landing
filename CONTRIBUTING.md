## Our commitment to open source

We are huge advocates of open source.
We believe all organisations should make their code as open as possible to the mutual benefit of employees, customers and the general benefit of developers who engage in open source.
Where possible, we will always release non-sensitive front-end pages under permissive, file-level copyleft, or weak project-level copyleft licenses to ensure ultimate benefit to all users.

## Mutual open-source pledge

Open source requires trust and commitment from both developers and maintainers of open-source code.
We are a for-profit company, motivated to create profits from our codebase, so we understand we have to _earn_ your trust.
To do that, we want to start by making a pledge to you about how we will use your open-source code.
In return, we ask that you make a pledge to us.

### Our pledge to you:

We will **never** rug pull.
If you submit code under an open-source license, it will always and forever be open source.
We may modify or copy code and use it in our proprietary codebase, but we will never relicense open-source code you provide under a proprietary license.
We will always consult our community about any chances to open-source licenses or community documentation such as our code of conduct.

### Your pledge to us:

You will agree, and **always** adhere to, our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
You will sign the [developer certificate of origin](#DCO) for all commits that you make.

## DCO

All contributions to the Codort codebase must be signed-off to indicate you have read and agreed to the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO), which we have pasted below.
To sign the DCO, simply add `-s` after all commits that you make, to do this easily you can make a git alias from the command line, for example:

`$ git config --global alias.cos "commit -s"`

```
